# Jest Presentation

This repository contains code examples I've written to highlight the different features of [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to students at Algonquin College. Create-react-app was used for this example.

# Setup Locally

1. Download [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) if it's not already installed on your machine
2. Use `npm install` in the project's root folder to install node modules

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
